# Typeclasses
{{<hint warning>}}
A `typeclass` is a way to define a set of behaviors (similar to an interface in other languages) that can be implemented by multiple types. Typeclasses enable *ad-hoc* polymorphism, allowing you to write generic functions that work with any type that implements the specified typeclass.
